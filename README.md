# UI Kit

## TODO

1. Decide on a workflow. Which components should come first? Which depend on others?

2. Add custom color argTypes to Button after creating color component.

3. Publish storybook online to Chromatic for public viewing. Include automatic publishing for github pushes https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/sharing/publish-storybook

### `npm start`
