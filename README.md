# UI Kit

A UI Kit made with Typescript and React and Demoed within Storybook. Styled with CSS Modules.

While Tailwind CSS is my go to framework for styling, I wanted to build this UI Kit with vanilla CSS3 to demonstrate my understanding of styling. For an example of my work in Tailwind CSS please refer to my portfolio build programmed in Typescript and Next.JS.
